This is a "100% Free Java" implementation of the Java language standard
class library.  Currently supported is the java.net package.  Soon this
will be part of the "real" jcl project, whose goal is to provide a 
complete clean room implementation of the Java class libraries that will
work with any JNI compliant JVM.

See the file INSTALL for details on installnig
See the file NEWS for details on what is included
See the various TODO and BUGS files in subdirectories for things that
might not work right or that need to be implemented.
