GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is the complete project
name for a "clean room" implementation of the Java class libraries.

It has become apparent through development that creating a classes.zip
which will work with the JVM shipped by Sun and ported to other
platforms like GNU/Linux will not be possible.  A file in this
directory called NoJDK lists all the classes we know create problems
with this.

Eventually, these essential libraries for Java will work with as many 
free JVMs as possible, such as Japhar and Kaffe.

See the file INSTALL for details on installing.
See the file NEWS for details on what is included.
See the various TODO and BUGS files in subdirectories for things that
might not work right or that need to be implemented.

Send comments/bug reports to classpath@gnu.org.  There is a website
devoted to GNU Classpath at www.classpath.org.
