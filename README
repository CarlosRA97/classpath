GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is a project to create
a complete "clean room" implementation of the Java class libraries 
that will also be free software.

Eventually, these essential libraries for Java will work with as many 
free JVMs as possible, such as Japhar and Kaffe.  However, currently
only Japhar is supported.

See the file INSTALL for details on installing.
See the file NEWS for details on what is included in this release.
See the various TODO and BUGS files in subdirectories for things that
might not work right or that need to be implemented.

Send comments/bug reports to classpath@gnu.org.  There is a website
devoted to GNU Classpath at http://www.classpath.org/.
