GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is a project to create
a complete "clean room" implementation of the Java class libraries 
that will also be free software.  Additionally GNU Classpath now includes
a sub-project called GNU Classpath Tools whose goal is to provide 
a number of free replacements for standard Java development tools like
javadoc, javap, javah, and others.

Eventually, these essential libraries for Java will work with as many 
free JVMs as possible.  Virtual machines known to use GNU Classpath
include:
	* GCJ 		(http://sources.redhat.com/java/)
	* ORP		(http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/orp/)
	* Kissme	(http://kissme.sourceforge.net/)
	* SableVM	(http://www.sablevm.org/)
	* Jupiter	(http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~doylep/jupiter/)

This is a development release only and is not ready for general
purpose use.
