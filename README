GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is a project to create
a complete "clean room" implementation of the Java class libraries 
that will also be free software.

Eventually, these essential libraries for Java will work with as many 
free JVMs as possible.  However, currently only Japhar is supported.  
Classpath support is included in Japhar 0.07 or later.  You will need 
to ensure you are at that release level or higher.  Details for 
obtaining Japhar are available from http://www.japhar.org/

This is a development release only and is not ready for general
purpose use.

See the file INSTALL for details on installing GNU Classpath.
See the file NEWS for details on what is included in this release.
See the file TODO for the latest to do list.
