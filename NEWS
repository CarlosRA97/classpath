New in release 0.03 (TBD)
* More merges with libgcj have been performed including java.math which now
  provides a pure Java implementation of that package.
* A pure Java implementation of java.util.zip is available.
* Includes jni.h now, eliminating the need to specify a particular VM
  via configure.
* No proprietary classes or programs are required to compile.
* Separation of compiling Java source and native libraries through the 
  configure mechanism.  If given no arguments, configure will setup the
  subsequent build to only produce Java bytecode (.class files).  More
  information is available in INSTALLING.
* Support for compiling in a separate directory, as an example you may
  cd classpath-0.03; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make
