New in release 0.03 (TBD)
* More merges with libgcj have been performed including java.math which now
  provides a pure Java implementation of that package.
  Current status at <http://gcc.gnu.org/java/libgcj-classpath-compare.html>
* A pure Java implementation (Jazzlib) of java.util.zip is available.
* Added the java.rmi implementation that Transvirtual donated to the FSF.
* Includes jni.h now, eliminating the need to specify a particular VM
  via configure.
* No proprietary classes or programs are required to compile.
  Compiles out of the box with jikes or gcj.
* Separation of compiling Java source and native libraries through the 
  configure mechanism.  If given no arguments, configure will setup the
  subsequent build to only produce Java bytecode (.class files).  More
  information is available in INSTALLING.
* Support for compiling in a separate directory, as an example you may
  cd classpath-0.03; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make
* Works with Orp 1.0.9 out of the box. Build instructions can be found at
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/doc/orp.html>
* Lots of bugfixes that were found by using Classpath with the gcj, Orp,
  SableVM, KissMe and Jaos VMs. Please use our bugdatabase at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=85>
* Lots of updates to make Classpath more compliant with the 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4
  API specification. The current status can be found at
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/status.html>
* All files are now distributed under the same terms. Added clarification to
  GPL exception.
