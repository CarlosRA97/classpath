This package was designed to use the GNU standard for configuration and
makefiles.  To build and install do the following:

1).  Run configure to configure the package: ./configure

2).  Type "make' to build the package

3).  Type "make install" to install everything.

Be sure that both Sun's JDK and Japhar are in your PATH and that
Sun's JDK comes first!

This setup currently has minimal configure support.  It looks for Japhar
in /usr/local/japhar and installs the code there.  In particular, it:

-- Installs the native libraries in /usr/local/japhar/lib
-- Installs the documentation in /usr/local/japhar/docs
-- Installs the Java classes in /usr/local/japhar/share

The Java classes are installed into an uncompressed directory structure. 
Any old code there will be overwritten, but certain stray classes used
by Sun might still be lying around.  To be sure you are running this
code, unzip your classes.zip or classes.jar, delete everything in 
java/net/*, then move classes.{zip,jar} off to another directory
besides share before installing/running.

4).  Run the tests if you'd like.  cd to test/java.net and run the
runtest script.  This will generate lots of out so redirect and grep
through it for FAILED.  Note that some things will doubtless fail as 
they are based on the specifics of my system.  Also note that you need
to have multicast enabled on your network interfaces and need to have
your tty/shell settings set to allow background processes to write to
the terminal.  You should also have the UDP daytime server enabled
in inetd.conf
