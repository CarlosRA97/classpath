Reflection is written and running.  No known functional changes need to be
made.  Now CLI ToReflected* and FromReflected* methods need to be written so
that this stuff can be tested.

Initial Version

Currently Reflection depends heavily on the VMI and JVMDI.  The only way I can
think of to deal with this is to make a VMI 1.1 API that handles what JVMDI
does not.  When one compiles the 1.1 version of Reflection, it can just use
that.

Field is not done yet.  Don't bother compiling it.

This whole thing is quite untested.  I am checking in now because I want
Geoffrey, the Serialization dude, to have some reference code to work with.
His stuff is not altogether different from mine, and in order to make his
code efficient he may need to borrow from mine.
