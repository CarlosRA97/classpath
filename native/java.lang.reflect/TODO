TODO for java.lang.reflect Native side:

- Field.c: reimplement almost everything.  Don't even know if this compiles.

- Note: I am planning on moving all JDK 1.2 dependencies to VMI so that 1.1 VMs
  like Kaffe that do not implement JVMDI can still interface to
  java.lang.reflect.

- Makefile needs to be created, as well.
