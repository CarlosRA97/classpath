DEPENDENCIES for JCL VMI library:

Japhar 1.1:
- Most functions depend on Japhar JVMDI.
- However, JNI and JCL functions are called by some of the
  non-JVMDI functions.
- Additionally:
  - VMI_GetFrameObject() depends on the StackFrame
    structure in Japhar's interp.h.
  - VMI_GetThisFrame() and VMI_GetThisThreadObject() depend
    on the JThreadInfo structure and the
    THREAD_getJavaInfo() function in Japhar's
    native-threads.h.
