OK, everything in the JCL libs is 1.1-compliant: if it uses
anything that could be VM-specific, it pawns the job off on
the VMI, whose job it is to interface to the virtual
machine.  Some of these dependencies will go away with
JVMDI in 1.2, but until then, VMI is the way to go.

jcl.h is for generically useful stuff: right now most of
the functions it has do some simple function, check for
errors, and throw an appropriate exception if an error
occurs.

primlib.h is a way of caching the reflective types and the
wrapper types and does a little conversion between types to
boot.

jnilink.h allows you to safely cache classes, fields and
methods in your native code.
