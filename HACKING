If you want to hack on GNU Classpath it will make things easier if you
have the following installed:

        - GNU autoconf 2.13
        - GNU automake 1.4
        - GNU libtool 1.3.3
        - Kaffe 1.0.5+
        - GTK 1.2
        - IBM jikes 1.0.9+

If you start from the current CVS version, you will have to run the
following from the toplevel directory.

        aclocal; autoheader; automake; autoconf

Next you run configure.  Options you'll probably want to specify
include --with-jikes, --with-javah={path to kaffeh},
--with-classlib={path to Klasses.jar}

Eventually jikes should contain a patch for placing .u (dependency
files) where -d would also place class files.

The following is a rough list of tasks which need to be completed:

        * Port to new platforms.  Most of us develop on GNU/Linux so
          our platform support may not be up to par.

        * java.awt.image needs to be stubbed out.

        * java.awt does not work yet.        

        * java.math needs some work.

        * GNU Classpath needs to work with Kaffe.  There is
          documentation on the efforts made to originally make
          Classpath work with Japhar in docs/ and on the web-site.

        * Update the web-site

        * Make multiple 'dist' targets for different packages
          including java.awt, java.lang, etc. but also for
          gnu.java.awt.peer.gtk.

        * Fix the build so that distributions won't have the same high
          requires as CVS.  Shouldn't be much left to do this.

        * Create configure, etc. for the swing project.

        * There are compiling errors located in lib/errors.txt (you
          have to try compiling first).

        * native compilation for the gtk peers is failing and needs to
          be fixed.

If you have any questions, suggestions, etc., send them to
<classpath@gnu.org>.
