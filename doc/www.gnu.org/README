All HTML files are generated from WML source.

If you wish to generate/view the HTML files locally, you'll need to
have wml and texi2html installed.  To make the HTML files, just
type "make".


Quick and dirty "How To"

How to create a webpage:

1. When working in a subdirectory, begin the page with:
   #!wml --include=..

2. Add:
   #include "include/layout.wml"

3. Add <subject "page title">

   this will set the page title to:
   "page title - GNU Project -Free Software Foundation (FSF)" 

4. Write your contents. Use the following pattern:

  <box>
    <boxtitle>...section title...</boxtitle>
    <boxitem>...section contents...</boxitem>

    <boxtitle>...section title...</boxtitle>
    <boxitem>...section contents...</boxitem>
  </box>

5. To change the menu entries, edit include/layout.wml

6. Call make to build the pages.

7. Set "CLASSPATH_WEBROOT" to a directory before calling "make publish"
   to deploy the pages locally

A few useful tags (defined in layout.wml)

* <createlink name="name" url="url>

creates a <a href="url">name</a> entry

Some pages define their own tags (e.g. faq.wml, tools.wml, downloads.wml)
to organize their content.
