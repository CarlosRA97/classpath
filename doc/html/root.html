Welcome to the homepage of the GNU Classpath project, a 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>
replacement for Sun's proprietary Java standard class libraries.  Our
goal is to provide a 100% compatible version of the class libraries
so that free operating systems can run Java programs.  We also want
to provide support for all Unix-like operating systems.

Classpath is GNU software and is licensed under the terms of
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library
General Public License</a>.  Similarly to glibc, it can be used
to run proprietary as well as free applications or applets.
