This section is woefully incomplete at the moment.  However we have a 
good document online here to cover how to work on GNU Classpath called the 
<a href="hacking.shtml">Hacker's Guide</a>.

<p>
The <a href="japhar.shtml">other document here</a> covers John Keiser's 
initial work on integration 
Japhar and GNU Classpath.  John posted to our website directions on detailing
how to get GNU Classpath to work with Japhar.  The Japhar integration is
not completely into Japhar's CVS tree as of yet and this patch is getting
dated.  Hopefully we'll have more news on this later.
