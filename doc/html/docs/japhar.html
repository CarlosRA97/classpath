The patch is not working right now due to changes in Japhar in the same places.  I am working to get a new patch in ... one which should be faster and more robust, as well.
<!--
<h2>1. Description of Patch</h2>
Well, after a long wait, it's finally here.  Right now, the Japhar
patch has *only* been tested on the following file:<P>
<pre>
public class Test 
{
  public static void main(String[] args) { }
}
</pre>
<p>
It seems like no test at all, but it can be very misleading.  What this
means is that <b>all static initializers</b> for the core Classpath
installation work just fine, and we do some fairly complex stuff in there,
including some Reflection.<p>
I am putting the patch out here so that the hackers of the world can begin
to send in bug reports, and also so that the Japhar guys can start to mess
with putting it into their tree and doing regression testing to make sure
the old stuff still works.<p>
If you install the patch, Japhar will still work the same way it used to
unless you use the configure option <code>--enable-classpath</code>.<p>

<h2>2. Getting the Patch</h2>
The patch is a tgz file available <a href="japhar-patch.tgz">here</a>.<p>
You also need a compiled copy of the Classpath library to work with Japhar.
Since our build procedure is not yet up to speed, I have the one I use
<a href="classpath.zip">here</a>.<p>

<h2>3. Installing the Patch</h2>
<b>A.</b> Change to the directory just above your Japhar directory and
untar japhar-patch.tgz.  <i>This only works right if your Japhar directory
is named</i> <code>japhar</code>.<p>
<b>B.</b> Use the unified diff patch.  To do this, stay in the directory
just above your Japhar directory and type
"<code>patch &lt; japharcp.diff</code>".<p>

<h2>4. Remake Japhar</h2>
When the patch is installed, you will need to remake Japhar with Classpath
enabled.<p>
<b>A.</b> Do the normal first steps in the Japhar HACKING file:
<code>aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake</code>.<p>
<b>B.</b> Run the configure script including the options
<code>--enable-classpath</code> and <code>--enable-libffi</code>.  You
may theoretically use any other options you want; but the only other ones
I have used in my testing are <code>--enable-debugging</code>,
<code>--enable-logging</code>, and <code>--with-sun-jdk=...</code>
(this last one is <i>still</i> required.<p>
<b>C.</b> Make and install normally.<p>

<h2>5. Install Classpath Libraries</h2>
Make and install the Classpath native libraries normally.  You
may have to do some hacking to exclude certain directories from the
build, if they are crashing on you.<p>

<h2>6. Set Environment Variables</h2>
<b>A.</b> Make sure that the path to the Classpath native libraries is
in your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.  Alternatively,
you can move the libraries to the Japhar libraries directory, but I have
not tested with that configuration yet.<p>
<b>B.</b> Put <code>classpath.zip</code> in your CLASSPATH.  Don't forget
to put "." in your classpath, or possibly the directory of the application
you want to run.<p>
<b>C.</b> Make sure, of course, that Japhar is in your <b>PATH</b>.

<h2>7. Finish</h2>
After performing steps 2-6 above, you will be ready to run!  There's not
much out of the ordinary there.  Just run "<code>japhar myClass</code>",
and thar she blows!<p>

<h2>8. Bugs and Comments</h2>
You should really send comments and bugfixes to
<a href="mailto:classpath@classpath.org">the Classpath list</a>, but if you
have a bone to pick with me, the author of this patch, my name is
John Keiser and my email is <a href="shalom@gnu.org">shalom@gnu.org</a>.<p>
