The GNU Classpath project was started in order to provide a clean-room
implementation of Sun's proprietary Java standard class libraries.
Those are the libraries commonly found in the <a 
href="java.shtml"><code>java</code></a> package.
We would also like to provide implementations of the standard extensions 
to the Java libraries which are part of the <a 
href="javax.shtml"><code>javax</code></a> package.

By clicking on the appropriate link you can see who is working on what
package or parts thereof.  There are also handy links in case you would 
like to email one of the package maintainers.

If there is something listed which you would like to work on you can
contact the maintainer to find out what might be available, or if no
maintainer is listed contact the <a 
href="mailto:classpath@gnu.org">mailing list</a> to let us know you are
interested in joining our effort!  There are certain legal qualifications
which have to be met which are outlined in the <a
href="../docs/hacking.shtml">Hacker's Guide</a>.  If you have questions
about the legal qualifications not answered in the Hacker's Guide send
email to the mailing list.
