I am pleased to announce GNU Classpath, a project to create a free
software replacement for Sun's proprietary Java core class libraries.
Classpath is a complete drop in replacement for Sun's libraries and
will include all native methods and internal classes necessary for
a completely functional Java runtime.  Additionally, we hope to have
fewer bugs than Sun's code, better performance, and better 
documentation. :-)
<p>
Here are the answers to a few questions you might have:
<p>
<h3>1.  Is code available?</h3>
<p>
Yes!  We have made substantial progress on the non-awt classes.  java.io,
java.net, java.lang.reflect, java.math, java.beans and much of java.lang, 
java.applet, and java.util are complete.  There has been no official
development release yet, but code is available through anonymous CVS.
See the project homepage at <a 
href="http://www.classpath.org/">http://www.classpath.org/</a> for details.  
This is most certainly NOT a vaporware project.
<p>
<h3>2.  What is the license?</h3>
<p>
Classpath is officially a part of the GNU Project.  Copyright will be
held by the FSF and the code will be licensed under the GNU Library
General Public License.  This license is compatible with the Netscape
Public License and will permit the embedding of Classpath into
Mozilla (eventually, we hope).
<p>
<h3>3.  What platforms are supported?</h3>
<p>
The Classpath project is initially planning to provide class library
for the free <a href="http://www.japhar.org/">Japhar 
Java Virtual Machine</a>
on free operating systems.  However, we
plan to eventually support all free JVM's running on all Unix-style
operating systems.  We will target other platforms such as Win32 at
a later time if there are volunteers to develop and support a port.
We are targeting Java 1.1 for the initial release, but we are already 
adding 1.2 support in lots of places.  
<p>
<h3>4.  Can I help?</h3>
<p>
Yes!  We are following an open development model and are actively
seeking contributions from the Net.  Assuming certain base legal 
requirements are met (see <a 
href="http://www.classpath.org/">http://www.classpath.org/</a> for details) 
we welcome submissions from almost anyone.
<p>
While the Java standard class library is quite large, it is
fortunately broken into smaller individual packages that are 
manageable to implement.  If you have always wanted to contribute to
building a free version of Java but didn't feel up to writing a JVM
or compiler, here is your chance to help out.
<p>
<h3>5.  What is your relationship to Kaffe?</h3>
<p>
Currently we don't have one.  Kaffe also has a start at a class library
effort.  We believe that with the exception of its awt support, that
library is at a similar level of development to ours.  Obviously
duplicating effort is wasteful, so we are currently in contact with
the Kaffe team to see if we can work together on this.
<p>
