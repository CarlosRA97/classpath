<h3>Classpath Project Status as of December 1, 1998</h3>
<p>
Progress continues.  John Kesier has successfully integrated the classpath
libraries with Japhar.  We now are able to run "Hello, World" using a
Japhar/Classpath combo.  Kudos to John.  John is working on a second patch
to Japhar which will hopefully be more easily incorporated in the near future.
<p>
As for the first public release, things are changing a bit.  Once we have
something buildable and runnable with Japhar, we will probably put out a
release of what we have to date.  This will include:
<p><ul>
<li>java.beans
<li>java.io
<li>java.lang
<li>java.lang.reflect
<li>java.math
<li>java.net
<li>java.util (partial)
<li>java.util.zip (probably)
</ul>
<p>These packages were chosen since they make up the minimally useful
Java runtime and/or were done.  Previously we planned to have all of
java.util done as well as java.text, but these will be a while and
Classpath should be minimally useful without them, so we will just go
ahead and put out a release when we are ready.  Loren Peace is making
good progress on java.util.zip, so that might be able to slip in as
an addition to our original list.
<p>
In other big news, the Classpath project is going to be cooperating
with Cygnus Solutions and Transvirtual Technologies in order to produce
a unified free test suite for Java.  This has developed into <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">project Mauve</a>.  There isn't
much at the website just yet, but there is a mailing list and some code!
<p>
Here is the status on a package by package basis.  Note that there are
still several package that aren't being worked on and so we still need
volunteers.
<p>
<h3>java.applet</h3>
Greg Smith has a start at a java.applet package and is working at writing
an appletviewer program for Classpath.

<p>
<h3>java.awt</h3>
Jim Blair and Paul Fisher continue to work on the GTK peers.  The current
work is progessing nicely.
<p>
<h3>java.beans</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has completed this package.
<p>
<h3>java.io - Serialization</h3>
Geoff Berry has basically finished off a 1.2 compatible serialization.
<p>
<h3>java.io</h3>
This class has gone through a cleanup for specification compliance and
doc generation.  A mostly Java 1.2 compatible version of this package 
is complete.  It is only missing permission classes and a few new changes 
in JDK 1.2beta4.  Aaron Renn plans on completing those once it becomes 
clear that Java 1.2 is stable.
<p>
<h3>java.lang</h3>
<p>
John Keiser and Brian Jones continue to plug away at this.  Many of the
difficult classes such as Character and String are complete.  Some work
has gone into bringing parts of java.lang up to 1.2 specification.  In the
near future we hope to have the native parts of Runtime.exec, Float, and
Double complete.
<p>
<h3>java.lang.reflect</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has finished a version of this, but it is largely untested.
He plans to complete the integration with Japhar and test RSN.
<p>
<h3>java.math</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher completed a version of this class using the GNU MP library.
<p>
<h3>java.net</h3>
Aaron Renn has completed a mostly complete Java 1.2 version of this.  It
is only missing URLClassLoader and miscellaneous changes that are new with
the JDK 1.2beta4.  Also, this package needs many more protocol and content
handlers.  The only supported protocol currently is http and only the GET
request method is supported there.  Only text/plain is supported with a
content handler.
<p>
<h3>java.security.*</h3>
Aaron Renn is started work on a Java 1.2 version of this.  The 
interface only packages (java.security.acl and java.security.interfaces)
are complete.  Work has been suspended here in order to concentrate on
classes relevant to the first development release.
<p>
<h3>java.sql</h3>
James Cooper is working on this
<p>
<h3>java.text</h3>
<p>
Aaron has written all of the collation classes in this package and is
planning on finishing off the formatting classes that Wes Biggs started.
<p>
<h3>java.util</h3>
<p>
Stuart Ballard as written much of the collection classes.  Greg Smith has
also done some work here.  Several people off the net such as Scott Miller,
Artur Biesiadowski, and Jon Zeppieri have also chipped in.
<p>
<h3>java.util.zip</h3>
<p>
Loren Peace is almost done with this class.
