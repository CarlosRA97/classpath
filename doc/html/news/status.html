<h3>Classpath Project Status as of November 1, 1998</h3>
<p>
Progress continues.  John Kesier has successfully integrated the classpath
libraries with Japhar.  We now are able to run "Hello, World" using a
Japhar/Classpath combo.  Kudos to John.  There is still work to do on this,
but we appear to be well on our way.  This integration requires a set of
patches to Japhar that will hopefully be incorporated soon.
<p>
As for the first public release, things are changing a bit.  Once we have
something buildable and runnable with Japhar, we will probably put out a
release of what we have to date.  This will include:
<p><ul>
<li>java.beans
<li>java.io
<li>java.lang
<li>java.lang.reflect
<li>java.math
<li>java.net
<li>java.util (partial)
<li>java.util.zip (probably)
</ul>
<p>These packages were chosen since they make up the minimally useful
Java runtime and/or were done.  Previously we planned to have all of
java.util done as well as java.text, but these will be a while and
Classpath should be minimally useful without them, so we will just go
ahead and put out a release when we are ready.  Loren Peace is making
good progress on java.util.zip, so that might be able to slip in as
an addition to our original list.
<p>
In other big news, the Classpath project is going to be cooperating
with Cygnus Solutions and Transvirtual Technologies in order to produce
a unified free test suite for Java.  This has developed into <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">project Mauve</a>.
<p>
Here is the status on a package by package basis.  Note that there are
still several package that aren't being worked on and so we still need
volunteers.
<p>
<h3>java.applet</h3>
Greg Smith has a start at a java.applet package and is working at writing
an appletviewer program for Classpath.

<p>
<h3>java.awt</h3>
Chris Toshok, master GUI hacker and Japhar developer is working on putting
together a set of GTK peers to provide awt support for Japhar on an
accelerated basis.  This is needed now that Japhar is integrated with
Mozilla.  We will be able to use these as our peer implementation.  Paul
Fisher is also doing work on the awt.
<p>
<h3>java.beans</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has completed this package.
<p>
<h3>java.io - Serialization</h3>
Geoff Berry has basically finished off a 1.2 compatible serialization.
<p>
<h3>java.io</h3>
A mostly Java 1.2 compatible version of this package is complete.  It is
only missing permission classes and a few new changes in JDK 1.2beta4.  Aaron
Renn plans on completing those once it becomes clear that Java 1.2 is stable.
<p>
<h3>java.lang</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher and John Keiser continue to plug away at this.  Many of the
difficult classes such as Character and String are complete. Brian Jones
wiped out the many small and tedious exception and error classes.  A major
recent addition is java.lang.Math by Paul.
<p>
<h3>java.lang.reflect</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has finished a version of this, but it is largely untested.
He plans to complete the integration with Japhar and test RSN.
<p>
<h3>java.math</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher completed a version of this class using the GNU MP library.
<p>
<h3>java.net</h3>
Aaron Renn has completed a mostly complete Java 1.2 version of this.  It
is only missing URLClassLoader and miscellaneous changes that are new with
the JDK 1.2beta4.  Also, this package needs many more protocol and content
handlers.  The only supported protocol currently is http and only the GET
request method is supported there.  Only text/plain is supported with a
content handler.
<p>
<h3>java.security.*</h3>
Aaron Renn is started work on a Java 1.2 version of this.  The 
interface only packages (java.security.acl and java.security.interfaces)
are complete.  Work has been suspended here in order to concentrate on
classes relevant to the first development release.
<p>
<h3>java.sql</h3>
James Cooper is working on this
<p>
<h3>java.text</h3>
<p>
Aaron has written all of the collation classes in this package and is
planning on finishing off the formatting classes that Wes Biggs started.
<p>
<h3>java.util</h3>
<p>
Stuart Ballard as written much of the collection classes.  Greg Smith has
also done some work here.  Several people off the net such as Scott Miller,
Artur Biesiadowski, and Jon Zeppieri have also chipped in.
<p>
<h3>java.util.zip</h3>
<p>
Loren Peace is almost done with this class.
