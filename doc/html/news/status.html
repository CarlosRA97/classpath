<h3>Classpath Project Status as of January 1, 1999</h3>
<p>
December was a big month for us.  Aaron Renn finished up the integration
of Classpath with the Japhar JVM.  Patches have been submitted to the
Japhar folks and will hopefully be applied to their CVS tree soon.
With this patch applied, you can actually use Classpath as your 
Java library for Japhar.
<p>
Substantial progress was also made on the Classpath build process.  Brian
Jones cleaned up the autoconf/automake items and used the JavaDeps tool
to generate correct dependency information for the build.  We are now
capable of creating a standard "tar.gz" distribution file that compiles
out of the box like any other GNU package (ie, "configure; make; make 
install")
<p>
Jochen Hoenicke contributed a large chunk of java.util classes that
round out that package for us.
<p>
What all this means is that a first development/alpha release of Classpath
that works with Japhar will be available extremely soon.  Probably as
soon as the necessary patches are accepted into Japhar.  This release
will include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>java.beans
<li>java.io
<li>java.lang
<li>java.lang.reflect
<li>java.math
<li>java.net
<li>java.security (partial)
<li>java.util
<li>java.util.zip (maybe)
</ul>
<p>
In addition to this first release, Paul Fisher and Jim Blair are 
making excellent progress on their set of GTK+ peers.  Next up on their
plate is the actual java.awt.* implementation.
<p>
In other big news, the Classpath project is going to be cooperating
with Cygnus Solutions and Transvirtual Technologies in order to produce
a unified free test suite for Java.  This has developed into <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">project Mauve</a>.  There isn't
much at the website just yet, but there is a mailing list and some code!
<p>
Here is the status on a package by package basis.  Note that there are
still several package that aren't being worked on and so we still need
volunteers.
<p>
<h3>java.applet</h3>
Greg Smith has a start at a java.applet package and is working at writing
an appletviewer program for Classpath.

<p>
<h3>java.awt</h3>
<p>
Jim Blair and Paul Fisher continue to work on the GTK peers.  The current
work is progessing nicely.
<p>
<h3>java.beans</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has completed this package.
<p>
<h3>java.io</h3>
<p>
Full Java 1.2 implementation complete.
<p>
<h3>java.lang</h3>
<p>
Mostly Java 1.2 implementation complete.  A few still do holes remain.
<p>
<h3>java.lang.reflect</h3>
<p>
Full Java 1.2 implementation complete
<p>
<h3>java.math</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher completed a version of this class using the GNU MP library.
<p>
<h3>java.net</h3>
<p>
Mostly Java 1.2 implementation complete.  Missing JarURLConnection and
URLClassLoader.  Included are protocol handlers for the "http" and "file"
protocol, and a "text/plain" content handler.  More need to be written,
however.  Note also that the HTTP protocol handler only supports the "GET"
request method.
<p>
<h3>java.security.*</h3>
Aaron Renn is started work on a Java 1.2 version of this.  The 
interface only packages (java.security.acl and java.security.interfaces)
are complete.  Work has been suspended here in order to concentrate on
classes relevant to the first development release.
<p>
<h3>java.sql</h3>
James Cooper is working on this.
<p>
<h3>java.text</h3>
<p>
Aaron has written all of the collation classes in this package and is
planning on finishing off the formatting classes that Wes Biggs started.
These are totally untested, however.
<p>
<h3>java.util</h3>
<p>
Lots of people have contributed to this package, which is now almost a full
Java 1.2 implementation.
<p>
<h3>java.util.zip</h3>
<p>
Loren Peace is almost done with this class.
