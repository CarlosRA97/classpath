<h3>Classpath Project Status as of September 1, 1998</h3>
<p>
We continue to make progress working on the core classes.  The
major issues facing the team are how to integrate with the JVM for those
classes (such as java.lang.Runtime) that require it and how we will build
the code.  The JDK javac program chokes trying to compile key packages 
such as java.lang and java.io.
<p>
Here is the status on a package by package basis.  Note that there are
still several package that aren't being worked on and so we still need
volunteers.
<p>
<h3>java.applet</h3>
Greg Smith has a start at a java.applet package and is working at writing
an appletviewer program for Classpath.

<p>
<h3>java.awt</h3>
Doug South is working on a set of GTK peers he calls GAWT.
<p>
<h3>java.beans</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has a working version of this that is complete.  He is now working
on some performance enhancements.  He is also trying to clarify some
ambiguities not fully spelled out in the spec.
<p>
<h3>java.io - Serialization</h3>
Geoff Berry is nearly complete with a Java 1.2 serialization implementation.
Java 1.1 is already done.  Serialization was a major worry of ours.  Kudos
to Geoff for knocking this one off.
<p>
<h3>java.io</h3>
A mostly Java 1.2 compatible version of this package is complete.  It is
only missing permission classes and a few new changes in JDK 1.2beta4.  Aaron
Renn plans on completing those once it becomes clear that Java 1.2 is stable.
<p>
<h3>java.lang</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher and John Keiser continue to plug away at this.  Many of the
difficult classes such as Character and String are complete.  The design
of classes that need to interface to the JVM is still being debated.
<p>
<h3>java.lang.reflect</h3>
<p>
John Keiser has finished a version of this, but it is largely untested.
He plans to complete the integration with Japhar and test RSN.
<p>
<h3>java.math</h3>
<p>
Paul Fisher completed a version of this class using the GNU MP library.
<p>
<h3>java.net</h3>
Aaron Renn has completed a mostly complete Java 1.2 version of this.  It
is only missing URLClassLoader and miscellaneous changes that are new with
the JDK 1.2beta4.  Also, this package needs many more protocol and content
handlers.  The only supported protocol currently is http and only the GET
request method is supported there.  Only text/plain is supported with a
content handler.
<p>
<h3>java.security.*</h3>
Aaron Renn is currently working on a Java 1.2 version of this.  The 
interface only packages (java.security.acl and java.security.interfaces)
are complete.
<p>
<h3>java.sql</h3>
James Cooper is working on this
<p>
<h3>java.text</h3>
<p>
Wes Biggs recently started work on this class.  Thanks to Wes for being
brave enough to risk brain damaged by coding a package this poorly designed.
<p>
<h3>java.util</h3>
<p>
Stuart Ballard as written much of the collection classes.  Greg Smith has
also done some work here.  Rumor has it there are also third party
implementations we could use.  A direction for how we finish off this
package needs to be determined.
