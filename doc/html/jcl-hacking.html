<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC1">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
The $classpath Project is a dedicated to providing a 100% free, clean room
implementation of the standard Java class libraries.  Because there is
currently no free implementation of the Java environment, no free
operating system can ship with Java included.  Parts of a free Java
implementation have already been written, including free Java virtual
machines (JVM's) such as <A HREF="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.hungry.com/products/japhar/">Japhar</A>, and Java compilers
such as <A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~engberg/guavac/">Guavac</A>.
However, there is currently no free replacement for Sun's proprietary
libraries.  This $classpath project aims to correct this problem by supplying a
free class library implementation that will allow a 100% free Java
platform to be distributed.  Note that Kaffe now ships with a partial
class library that is also free, so there is more than one group working
towards a common goal.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC2">Requirements</A></H1>

<P>
Although $classpath is following an open development model where input from
developers is welcome, there are certain base requirements that need to
be met by anyone who wants to contribute code to this project.  They are
mostly unfortunately dictated by legal requirements and are not
arbitrary restrictions chosen by the $classpath team.

</P>
<P>
You will need to adhere to the following things if you want to donate
code to the $classpath project:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<B>Never under any circumstances refer to Sun's code while working on
$classpath.</B>  It is best if you have never looked at Sun's code at all.  To
reduce temptation, it would be best if you deleted the <SAMP>`src.zip'</SAMP>
file from your JDK distribution.  If you have signed Sun's
non-disclosure statement, then you unfortunately cannot work on $classpath code
at all.  If you have any reason to believe that your code might be
"tainted", please say something on the mailing list before writing
anything.  If it turns out that your code was not developed in a clean
room environment, we could be very embarrassed someday in court.  Please
don't let that happen.

<LI>

<B>Never decompile Sun's class libraries.</B>  While the wording of the
license in Sun's JDK version 1.2 has changed, it not acceptable, under
any circumstances, for a person working on $classpath to decompile Sun's class
libraries.  Allowing the use of decompilation in the $classpath project would
open up a giant can of legal worms, which we wish to avoid.

<LI>

$classpath is licensed under the terms of the
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library General Public
License</A>.  To preserve freedom for all users and to maintain uniform
licensing of $classpath, we will not accept code into the main distribution
that is not licensed under these terms.

<LI>

$classpath is GNU software and this project is being officially sponsored by
the <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</A>.  Because of this,
the FSF will hold copyright to all code developed as part of $classpath.  This
will allow them to pursue copyright violators in court, something an
individual developer may neither have the time nor resources to do.
Everyone contributing code to $classpath will need to sign a copyright assignment
statement.  Additionally, if you are employed as a programmer, your
employer may need to sign a copyright waiver disclaiming all interest in
the software.  This may sound harsh, but unfortunately, it is the only
way to ensure that the code you write is legally yours to distribute.
</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC3">Volunteering to Help</A></H1>

<P>
The $classpath project needs volunteers to help us out.  People are needed to
write unimplemented Java packages, to test $classpath on various platforms, and to
port it to platforms that are currently unsupported.

</P>
<P>
While pretty much all contributions are welcome (but see 
see section <A HREF="jcl-hacking.html#SEC2">Requirements</A>) it is always preferable that volunteers do the
whole job when volunteering for a task.  So when you volunteer to write
a Java package, please be willing to do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Implement a complete drop-in replacement for the particular package.  That
means implementing any "internal" classes.  For example, in the java.net
package, there are non-public classes for implementing sockets.  Without
those classes, the public socket interface is useless.  But do not feel
obligated to completely replace all of Sun's functionality at once.  For
example, in the java.net package, there are different types of protocol
handlers for different types of URL's.  Not all of these need to be
written at once.

<LI>

Please write complete and thorough javadoc comments for every public and
protected method and variable.  These should be superior to Sun's and cover 
everything about the item being documented.

<LI>

Please write a regression test package that can be used to run tests of
your package's functionality.
</UL>

<P>
Nobody likes to write documentation and test cases, but they are vital to
a complete and robust product.  Writing them as you go is much easier than
going back at the end and adding them.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC4">Project Goals</A></H1>

<P>
The goal of the $classpath project is to produce a  
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</A> implementation
of the standard class library for Java.  However, there are other more
specific goals as to which platforms should be supported.

</P>
<P>
$classpath is targeted to support the following operating systems:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Free operating systems.  This includes GNU/Linux, {Free,Net,Open}BSD, and
GNU/Hurd.

<LI>

Other Unix like operating systems

<LI>

Platforms which currently have no Java support at all such as the Amiga.

<LI>

Other platform such as MS-Windows.
</OL>

<P>
While free operating systems are the top priority, the other priorities 
can shift depending on whether or not there is a volunteer to port $classpath
to those platforms and to test releases.

</P>
<P>
Eventually we hope the $classpath will support all JVM's that provide JNI
support.  However, the top priority is free JVM's.  The JVM support
priority list is:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Japhar
<LI>

Kaffe
<LI>

Sun's JDK
<LI>

Other JNI Compliant JVM's.
</OL>

<P>
As with OS platform support, this priority list could change if a volunteer
comes forward to port, maintain, and test releases for a particular JVM.
Kaffe is now developing its own class library, so the priority of supporting
that platform is not nearly as high as for Japhar.

</P>
<P>
The initial target version for $classpath is Java 1.1.  Java 1.2 can be 
implemented if desired, but please do not create classes that depend
on 1.2 features in other packages.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC5">Programming Tools</A></H1>

<P>
If you want to hack on $classpath, you should download, install,
and familiarize yourself with the following tools:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

CVS 1.9
<LI>

automake 1.3
<LI>

autoconf 2.12
<LI>

dejagnu 1.3
<LI>

libtool 1.2
<LI>

GNU m4 1.4
<LI>

perl 5.X
<LI>

GNU MP 2.0.2
</UL>

<P>
All of these tools are available from
<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">prep.ai.mit.edu</A> via anonymous ftp.
With the exception of perl, they are fully documented with
texinfo manuals.  Texinfo can be browsed with the Emacs editor, or with
the text editor of your choice.

</P>
<P>
Here is a brief description of the purpose of those tools.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>CVS</B>
<DD>
A version control system that maintains a centralized Internet
repository of all code in the $classpath system.  Access to the repository
requires an account.  Contact Paul Fisher (<A HREF="mailto:rao@gnu.org">rao@gnu.org</A>) for
details.

<DT><B>dejagnu</B>
<DD>
A package for automating regression test suites for programs.  Your 
regression test package should work with this.

<DT><B>automake</B>
<DD>
This tool automatically creates Makefile.in files from
Makefile.am files.  The Makefile.in is turned into a Makefile by autoconf.
Why use this?  Because it automatically generates every makefile target
you would ever want (clean, install, dist, etc) in full compliance with
the GNU coding standards.  It also simplifies Makefile creation in a
ton of different ways I can't describe here.  Read the docs for more info.

<DT><B>autoconf</B>
<DD>
Automatically configures a package for the platform on
which it is being built and generates the Makefile for that platform.

<DT><B>libtool</B>
<DD>
Handles all of the zillions of hairy platform specific 
options needed to build shared libraries.

<DT><B>m4</B>
<DD>
The free GNU replacement for the standard Unix macro processor.  Proprietary
m4 programs are broken and so GNU m4 is required for autoconf to work.

<DT><B>perl</B>
<DD>
Larry Wall's scripting language.  It is used internally by automake.

<DT><B>MP</B>
<DD>
Required for java.lang.Float, java.lang.Double, java.math.BigInteger, and
java.math.BigDecimal.

<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC6">Programming Standards</A></H1>

<P>
For C code, follow the 
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding Standards</A>.  
The standards also specify various things like the
install directory structure.  These should be followed if possible.

</P>
<P>
For Java code, please follow the
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventionsTOC.doc.html">Sun programming standards</A>.
As an exception, do not feel obligated to following their bracket and
indentation style if you consider it wrong as I do.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC7">Programming Goals</A></H1>

<P>
When you write code for $classpath, write with three things in mind, and in the
following order: portability, robustness, and efficiency.

</P>
<P>
If efficiency breaks portability or robustness, then don't do it the
efficient way.  If robustness breaks portability, then bye-bye robust code.
Of course, as a programmer you would probably like to find sneaky ways to
get around the issue so that your code can be all three ... the following
chapters will give some hints on how to do this.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC8">Portability</A></H1>

<P>
The ultimate portability goal would be to create:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

a binary set for each platform that works across all VMs on that
platform
<LI>

a single classfile set that work across all VMs on all platforms that
support the binary set.
</OL>

<P>
With Java code, this is no problem.  You end up delegating VM- or
platform-specific stuff to native code anyway.  Unfortunately, it is
impossible to write native code that works out of the box on multiple
VMs, even on a given platform.  The APIs Sun has created just do not
give the flexibility required to do that if you are implementing the
java.* hierarchy.

</P>
<P>
The native libraries we use in $classpath are JNI, JVMDI, and VMI.  JNI you
should be familiar with; introduced in Java 1.1, it is the basis for
our native code.  JVMDI is a 1.2 concoction, and thus we can only
support it on 1.1 VMs that we have source access to (i.e. Japhar and
Kaffe).  VMI is our own invention entirely; it is where we push the
VM-specific functionality that JNI and JVMDI do not support.

</P>
<P>
However, using JVMDI and VMI in 1.1 breaks the "ideal goal" for the project.
With these two in the mix, $classpath's portability becomes:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

a JVMDI and VMI lib per VM per platform;
<LI>

a binary set for each platform that works across all VM/platform
combos supporting the JVMDI/VMI;
<LI>

a single classfile set that works across all VM / platform combos
that support both of the above.
</OL>

<P>
When writing, therefore, you should always keep shy of anything
VM-specific yourself, and talk to the VM using the VMI.  If you need a
VM-specific function that is not supported by JNI or JVMDI, write a new VMI
function!

</P>
<P>
Note that the preferred method is not to use the JVMDI or VMI at <EM>all</EM>,
but to use only JNI.  If you can write it without the VMI, your code will be
quicker to port to new VMs.

</P>
<P>
There is another issue, however, and that is the efficiency issue.  Some
things can be done using JNI only, but they are a ton slower than they would
be if you used the VMI or talked directly to the VM.

</P>
<P>
In these cases, the preferred method in $classpath is to create a <EM>library</EM>.
Hide the implementation of the functions from the caller.  If the library
can be written using only JNI, no matter how inefficient, you should write a
version of it for that.  Portability, remember, is the ultimate goal, and
the closer we are to it, the better off we are.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC9">Robustness</A></H1>

<P>
Native code is very easy to make non-robust.  (That's one reason Java is so
much better!)  Here are a few hints to make your native code more robust.

</P>
<P>
Always check return values for standard functions.  It's sometimes easy to
forget to check that malloc() return for an error.  Don't make that mistake.
(In fact, use JCL_malloc() in the jcl library instead--it will check the
return value and throw an exception if necessary.)

</P>
<P>
Always check the return values of JNI functions, or call <CODE>ExceptionOccurred</CODE>
to check whether an error occurred.  You must do this after <EM>every</EM> JNI call.
JNI does not work well when an exception has been raised, and can have unpredictable
behavior.

</P>
<P>
Throw exceptions using JCL_ThrowException.  This guarantees that if something is
seriously wrong, the exception text will at least get out somewhere (even if it is
stderr).

</P>
<P>
Check for null values of jclasses before you send them to JNI functions.  JNI
does not behave nicely when you pass a null class to it: it terminates Java with
a "JNI Panic."

</P>
<P>
In general, try to use functions in native/lib/jcl.h.  They check exceptions and
return values and throw appropriate exceptions.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC10">Java Efficiency</A></H1>

<P>
For methods which explicitly throw a NullPointerException when an
argument is passed which is null, per a Sun specification, do not write
code like:

</P>

<PRE>
int strlen(String foo) throws NullPointerException {
  if (foo == null)
    throw new NullPointerException("foo is null");
  return foo.length();
}
</PRE>

<P>
Instead, the code should be written as:

</P>

<PRE>
int strlen(String foo) throws NullPointerException {
  return foo.length();
}
</PRE>

<P>
Explicitly comparing foo to null is unnecessary, as the virtual machine
will throw a NullPointerException when length() is invoked.  $classpath is
designed to be as fast as possible -- every optimization, no matter how
small, is important.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC11">Native Efficiency</A></H1>

<P>
You might think that using native methods all over the place would give
our implementation of Java speed, speed, blinding speed.  You'd be thinking
wrong.  Would you believe me if I told you that an <EM>interpreted</EM> Java method
is typically about three and a half times <EM>faster</EM> than the equivalent
native method?  This is true even for a totally blank method.

</P>
<P>
Bottom line: JNI is overhead incarnate.  In Sun's implementation, even
the JNI functions you use once you get into Java are slow.

</P>
<P>
A final problem is efficiency of native code when it comes to things
like method calls, fields, finding classes, etc.  Generally you should cache
things like that in static C variables if you're going to use them over and
over again.  GetMethodID(), GetFieldID(), and FindClass() are *slow*.

</P>
<P>
Here are a few tips on writing native code efficiently:

</P>
<P>
Make as few native method calls as possible.  Note that this is not the same
thing as doing less in native method calls; it just means that, if given the
choice between calling two native methods and writing a single native method
that does the job of both, it will usually be better to write the single
native method.  You can even call the other two native methods directly from
your native code and not incur the overhead of a method call from Java to C.

</P>
<P>
Cache methodIDs and fieldIDs wherever you can.  String lookups are expensive.
The best way to do this is to use the native/lib/jnilink.h library.  It will
ensure that jmethodIDs are always valid, even if the class is unloaded at
some point.  In 1.1, jnilink simply caches a NewGlobalRef() to the method's
underlying class; however, when 1.2 comes along, it will use a weak reference
to allow the class to be unloaded and then re-resolve the jmethodID the next
time it is used.

</P>
<P>
Cache classes that you need to access often.  jnilink will help with this as
well.  The issue here is the same as the methodID and fieldID issue--how to
make certain the class reference remains valid.

</P>
<P>
If you need to associate native C data with your class, use Paul
Fisher's native_state library (NSA).  It will allow you to get and set state
fairly efficiently.  Note that there is no built-in mechanism to associate C
data with instances of a class.  This is a library Paul built from scratch.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="jcl-hacking.html#TOC12">Specification Sources</A></H1>

<P>
There are a number of specification sources to use when working on $classpath.
In general, the only place you'll find your classes specified is in the
JavaDoc documentation or possibly in the corresponding white paper.  In
the case of java.lang, java.io and java.util, you should look at the
Java Language Specification.

</P>
<P>
Here, however, is a list of specs, in order of canonicality:

<P>
Here is a brief description of the toplevel directories and their contents.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>java</B>
<DD>
Contains the source code to the Java packages that make up 
the core class library.  Because this is the public interface to Java,
it is important that the public classes, interfaces, methods, and variables
are exactly the same as specified in Sun's documentation.  The directory
structure is laid out just like the java package names.  For example, the
class java.util.zip would be in the directory java/util/zip.

<DT><B>gnu/java</B>
<DD>
Internal classes (roughly analogous to Sun's sun.* classes)
should go under the gnu/java directory.  Classes related to a particular
public Java package should go in a directory named like that package.  For
example, classes related to java.util.zip should go under a directory
gnu/java/util/zip.  Sub-packages under the main package name are allowed.
For classes spanning multiple public Java packages, pick an appropriate
name and see what everybody else thinks.

<DT><B>native</B>
<DD>
This directory holds native code needed by the public
Java packages.  Each package has its own subdirectory, which is the
"flattened" name of the package.  For example, native method implementations
for java.util.zip should go in native/java.util.zip.

<DT><B>test</B>
<DD>
This directory contains test packages written for DejaGnu used
to test releases of $classpath.  The test scripts for a given package go in the
subdirectory that is the same as the "flattened" name of the package.  For
example, test scripts for java.util.zip should go in test/java.util.zip

<DT><B>compat</B>
<DD>
This directory contains misc scripts designed not to
test an implementation, but to determine various things about Sun's
reference implementation that are needed in order to write a compatible
package.  Each package has its own directory which is the "flattened"
package name.  For example, compatibility scripts for java.util.zip
go in compat/java.util.zip

Each person working on a package get's his or her own "directory
space" underneath each of the toplevel directories.  In addition to the
general guidelines above, the following standards should be followed:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Classes that need to load native code should load a library with the
same name as the flattened package name, with all periods removed.  For
example, the native library name specified in LoadLibrary for
java.util.zip would be "javautilzip".

<LI>

Each package has its own shared library for native code (if any).  The
actual library name to be built will depend on the target JVM.

<LI>

The main native method implementation for a given method in class should
go in a file with the same name as the class with a ".c" extension.
For example, the implementation of the native methods in
java.util.InetAddress would go in native/java.net/InetAddress.c.
"Internal" native functions called from the main native method can
reside in files of any name.
