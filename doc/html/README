To update the website...

If you simply want to change some of the present content, find the correct
HTML file and modify it.

If you want to add a submenu or a major menu, you have to change the conf.pm
file in the includes/ directory, and rerun includes/create-menus.pl.

If you add new HTML files which you want to be bordered by the right menu, 
etc. (and you've already updated conf.pm and executed create-menus.pl)
Then all you have to do is execute create-shtml.pl.  This will create (update)
.shtml files which are pre-existing.  To get a new one for say news/kaffe.html
I would have to first `touch news/kaffe.shtml' before executing 
create-shtml.pl.

For the root directory, the main content html file is root.html.
The .shtml file for this directory is index.shtml.

For other sub directories the main content html file is `directory'.html.
The .shtml file for this is `directory'/index.shtml

For other files in any directory the main content html file is `filename'.html
and the .shtml file is `filename'.shtml.

Limitations:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The create-menus.pl script isn't as robust as the one once used at 
   OryxSoft, Inc.  I lost that one in a harddrive wipe so this is a 
   recreation which still needs work.
2. The create-shtml.pl script is recursive and should be able to handle
   any number of sub directories.
3. A few things are difficult to reference with relative URLs, like the
   gnu image you see on most pages.
4. We can currently only have 2 levels in the menu structure due to (1).
   Other sub directories can be created, but won't be in the menu.


TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Remove every limitation we can.
2. Make it more robust.
3. More than likely write the create-menus.pl script in something other than
   Perl.
