DEPENDENCIES of java.lang.reflect Java side.

1.1:
No known direct dependencies on 1.2 or even 1.1-specific
stuff.  While java.lang.Class methods defined in 1.1 are
the only way to create these classes, once they are created
they do not depend on any 1.1-specific methods.  The native
side, however, is a different story, so this stuff really
couldn't run on 1.0.
