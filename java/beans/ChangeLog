Sun Aug 9 10:40:29 MDT 1998: John Keiser (jkeiser@iname.com)

     Initial ChangeLog.  Most things are done now, Beans class itself is
     untested, and Introspector needs an efficiency overhaul now that I have
     got it compliant.  Introspection performs 50-100% slower than Sun's on Sun
     JDK.  It should be noted that the reason for the slowness is probably
     because I over-interpreted the Sun specification and tried to make
     everything as explicit as possible; perhaps by a looser interpretation of
     the introspection spec, one could get better performance (though with more
     ambiguous results).
