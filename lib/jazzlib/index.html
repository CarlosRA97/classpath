<h1>A pure java implementation of the java.util.zip library</h1>

This project provides an implementation of the java.util.zip classes.
<br><br>
The code is pure java (no native code is used), and we aim to be compatible with existing java.util.zip implementations. Some code was borrowed from libgcj, almost all the rest was written by Jochen Hoenicke.
<br><br>
There is very similar project at <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/index.html">http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/index.html</a>.<br>
Another project to implement bzip2 is at <a href="http://www.aftexsw.com/aftex/products/java/bzip/">http://www.aftexsw.com/aftex/products/java/bzip/</a>
<p>
For the latest source, see the classpath CVS repository, from time to time we will build releases of the jazzlib code in the net.sf.jazzlib namespace. These are useful for situations where native code isn't allowed (such as in applets) and you need to use zip files. Builds in the java.util.zip namespace are also available, these have a -juz suffix.

There is a md5sums file in each release that you can use to check the integrity of the files. The md5sums is also signed with my public key (finger jewel at debian.org), the signature is in md5sums.asc.
